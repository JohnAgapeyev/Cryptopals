/**
 * This challenge is intentionally left empty.
 * I spent several days analyzing various C implementations of both
 * SHA1 and the solutions to this challenge.
 * I was unable to understand those solutions sufficiently enough that
 * I was confident I could modify their internal state as is required for this challenge.
 * I even tried to write my own SHA1 implementation, but that failed.
 * As such, the only way I'd have a solution to this challenge is to blatantly copy from others.
 * Which is frankly a waste of my time, and wouldn't teach me anything.
 * So rather than being stuck on this challenge for potentially weeks, I'm choosing to skip this and challenge 29
 * in order to move on to the rest of the challenges.
